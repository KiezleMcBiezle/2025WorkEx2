                <h2>How did we come to be?</h2>
                <p>Bareform is steeped in tradition. Formed in 1956 by a trio of fashion connoisseurs, Bareform rose to fame and has been topping the market of simplicity ever since. The unique ideas of Sigvard Lévesque, Pavan Statham and Konrad Ford still live and breathe in every piece of clothing Bareform produces. Bareform sees fashion like no other, and sticks truly by it's motto - just be Bareform.</p>
